    "\n",
    "We strongly recommend you first to go through a very good [tutorial from TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/mnist/pros). You can borrow implementation details from them, especially for convolutions and pooling layers, but make sure to implement our architecture! If you just apply the architecture from that tutorial to CIFAR-10 dataset, you will not receive many points. And please note, that this tutorial considers MNIST dataset, which has grayscale digits. However, CIFAR-10 has images in RGB. There is also another [tutorial by TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/deep_cnn), which shows AlexNet architecture (now outdated!) applied to CIFAR-10. But it is much more advanced than the first one.\n",

But unfortunately, really deep CNNs cannot be trained on ordinary laptops.\n",

    "- Convolution should preserve dimensions (use 'SAME'). \n",
    "- Global average pooling means that we simply average all our values inside each feature map. So on the 3-rd convolutional layer we have 30 feature maps of size 8x8. After global average pooling we get only 30 values of averaged 8x8 feature maps.\n",
    "- Use ReLU as activaton function\n",
    "- We use softmax + cross-entropy loss, and no elementwise sigmoids. Make sure that you use average cross-entropy per batch in order to make an update! Otherwise recommended lambda and learning rate will not be a good choice.\n",
    "- For optimization you can use Adam with the learning rate given above (0.005), and all other parameters set by default. \n",
    "- Please train the model for 10 epochs with batch size = 100. Please note, that 10 epochs is not actually a lot, and we can get substantial improvement if we go beyond 10 epochs. We just want to be sure that 10 epochs can be done in a reasonable amount of time on any kind of laptop that you may have.\n",
    "- Use TensorBoard to **display the computation graph** defined by your model. Additonally, use TensorBoard to **log the test error, training error and training loss function** of your network for each epoch (again, you can use [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/summaries_and_tensorboard) for reference). To speed up the training process, it's not necessary to report training accuracy on all 50000 examples, you can just take first 1000 examples.\n",
    "- Don't forget about L2 regularization of all weights (both convolutional and fully connected). Recommended $\\lambda$ is 0.0001.\n",
